# Amazing-Numbers
This program will give you the properties of a certain number.
Your input can be either one or two numbers.
You also can search for numbers with a property.
To do that you give two numbers and any number of properties you would like to search for.
You can also put a - in front of a property so it will only look for numbers who don't have that property.
